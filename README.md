Python codes for Factory Line Automation for invetory management
The python code is used for cross checking the invetory
in our scenario every component have a barcode so cross checking if no more than component with same barcode
once a barcode is scanned it chnages the barcode number to green and bold in the excel sheet with which the the inventory is being cross verified 
it will also give a message as "Verified, go ahead!"
if the barcode is repeated it will change the green barcode to red in the excel sheet with which is being cross verified.
